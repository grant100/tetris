# Tetris-Game for Raspberry Pi + Unicorn Hat
No game engines or libraries used. 

Classic Tetris game to played on Pimoroni's Unicorn Hat. Still under development. So far worked out matrix transformation for point/shape rotations. Currently developing overall game logic now that rotations pieces are complete. 
All code is developed by me.
