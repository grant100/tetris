# Tetris-Game for 32x32 RGB LED Matrix on Raspberry Pi 3
No game engines or libraries used. 

Classic Tetris game built for a 32x32 RGB LED Matrix. 
Game is built on hzeller's rpi-rgb-led-matrix library found here (it's awesome): https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix


#Project Description
This is my personal stab at simple game development... and is soley for fun.
For this project I used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a 32x32 RGB LED Matrix, and an Adafruit RGB Matrix hat, the hat and matrix I picked up online from Adafruit's website.

# Instructions

For Unicorn hat:
	
	git checkout unicorn-hat-pimoroni

For 32x32 LED Matrix:

	git checkout rgb-led-matrix


Finally: 

	sudo python Main.py // Begins execution

	press 'b' to exit

# Bugs
Some colors don't render correclty on the unicorn hat and are either invisible or difficult to see

Classic Tetris game to played on Pimoroni's Unicorn Hat. 
All code is developed by me (with exclusion of unicorn library of course).
