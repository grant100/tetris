No game engines or libraries used. 

Classic Tetris game built for a 32x32 RGB LED Matrix. 
Game is built on hzeller's rpi-rgb-led-matrix library found here (it's awesome): https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix


#Project Description
This is my personal stab at simple game development... and is soley for fun.
For this project I used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a 32x32 RGB LED Matrix, and an Adafruit RGB Matrix hat, the hat and matrix I picked up online from Adafruit's website.
